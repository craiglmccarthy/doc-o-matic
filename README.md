# Doc-o-matic

Automated production of MARC 21 catalogue records from pdf documents.

This was built as an automation tool to speed up the cataloguing process of 
predictable documents.

The program accepts a URL to a pdf document, parses the document using regular 
expressions and creates a MARC 21 record. The MARC 21 record can later be 
imported into a Library Management System.
